Description: streaming media server
 Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg
 streaming including the Vorbis and Theora codecs. Icecast can also
 handle other streams like MP3/AAC/NSV. It can be used to create an
 Internet radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things
 in between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added
 relatively easily and supports open standards for communication and
 interaction.
