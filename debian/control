Description: Ogg Vorbis and MP3 streaming media server
 Icecast is a streaming media server which currently supports Ogg 
 Vorbis and MP3 audio streams. It can be used to create an Internet 
 radio station or a privately running jukebox and many things in 
 between. It is very versatile in that new formats can be added 
 relatively easily and supports open standards for communication and 
 interaction.
