icecast2 (2.3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU. Closes: bug#375253.
  * Build-depend on libtheora-dev again (but at least alpha7), as later
    suggested in the above bug#375253. Closes: bug#308939.
  * Bump standards-version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed).

icecast2 (2.3.1-3.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Disable Theora support (by removing Depends and Build-Depends on
    libtheora0 and libtheora-dev, adding a Build-Conflicts on libtheora-dev
    instead); the 0.0.0.alpha6 version is currently too unstable (see
    #340175), and 0.0.0.alpha5 is no longer in the archive. This fixes both
    FTBFS (Closes: #373855) and missing dependency (Closes: #373818) problems,
    but it reopens #308939.

icecast2 (2.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small adjustments to debian/copyright:
    + Remove note on "FSF address adjusted" (it was stripped instead).
    + Correct path to src/httpp (not src/httpd).
    + Mention src/httpp licensing info only once.
    + Info for src/httpp covers src/timing too.
  * Update local cdbs snippet auto-update.mk:
    + Drop unneeded buildcore.mk inclusion.
    + Avoid problematic build-essential build-dependency.
  * Update local cdbs snippet copyright-check.mk:
    + Support changing the scope of files found.
    + Treat all found files as non-binary.
  * Bump to standards-version 3.7.1 (no changes needed).
  * Semi-auto-update debian/rules.
  * Tightening (build-)dependency on libtheora to avoid the crashing
    bugs mentioned in (but unrelated to) bug#340175. This also for sure
    closes: Bug#308939 (thanks to <j@v2v.cc>).

icecast2 (2.3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This package is now team-maintained!
    + Debian Icecast team <pkg-icecast-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>

    + If you want to help improve the package or want other Icecast-
      related packages maintained here then drop an email to the above
      mailinglist!
  * Move auto-update of debian/control out in reusable cdbs snippet.
  * Minor update to other cdbs snippets (non-unique cdbs namespace).
  * Auto-update debian/control, and manually strip build-essential from
    build-dependencies to not upset ftp-masters.

icecast2 (2.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-depend on libcurl3-gnutls-dev (not libcurl-dev) to avoid

    includes DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=update.
  * Auto-update build-dependencies (and manually rip out build-essential
    buggily sneaking in).
  * Fix watch file by simplifying it (seems uscan wrongly parse it as a
    newer version format).
  * Build-depend only on virtual package libcurl-dev (not libcurl3-dev).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed, 13 Jul 2005 17:42:57 +0200

  * New upstream release. Closes: bug#286739 (thanks - again - to Andre
    Tomt <andre@tomt.net>).
  * Debian subdir is again stripped from tarball, but autotools patching
    (to aboid complaints about the missing dir) is now in diff. Updated
    note in debian/copyright.
  * Build-depend on libtheora-dev (current version is too old but as
    soon as libtheora is updated it will then get built in).
  * Updated source location in debian/copyright and debian/watch.
  * Correct typo in long description.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed, 29 Dec 2004 15:04:17 +0100

    + Add note about tarball not being pristine (and explain why).
    + Use capital "I" in initial introduction to upstream name.
  * Use generic (but unofficial) buildinfo cdbs snippet.
  * Drop cleaning up conf/icecast.xml.dist (handled properly upstream
    now).
  * Set urgency=medium to hopefully reach sarge.
  * Correct README.Debian to mention user "icecast2" (not "icecast").
  * Move and symlink stylesheet to /etc (similar to xslt files).

  * Use more flexible regexp in watch file.
  * Rename Debian NEWS file in source to get recognized automativally.
  * Devine man page within rules file.
  * Drop unneeded preinst (from a time before official Debian where it
    did not run properly as a daemon?).
  * Build-depend on libcurl3-dev, and on the virtual package libcurl-dev
    only as fallback (not mandatory, but aptitude chokes and so will the
    build daemons as well, I suppose).
  * Reload (which does a sighup) daemon after logrotate. Closes:
    bug#265301 (thanks to David Pashley <david@davidpashley.com>).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Sat,  2 Oct 2004 11:27:14 +0200

icecast2 (2.0.1.debian-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tolerate failure to remove icecast group on purge (it is used by
    other packages as well, and was badly handled in older unstable
    packages). This closes: Bug#246263 (thanks to Pete de Zwart
    <dezwart@froob.net>).
  * Fix logrotate script. Closes: Bug#249404, #255430 (thanks

  * Build-depend generically on libxslt-dev and libcurl-dev (instead of
    libxslt1-dev and libcurl2-dev).

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Wed,  7 Jul 2004 09:32:56 +0200

icecast2 (2.0.1.debian-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Really add ChangeLog from 2.0.0.

 -- Jonas Smedegaard <dr@jones.dk>  Thu, 20 May 2004 23:03:22 +0200

icecast2 (2.0.1.debian-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (thanks to Ian Kumlien <pomac@vapor.com>):
    + According to announcement on website, it "fixes a overflow buffer
      which can cause server crashes under certain circumstances" so set
      urgency=medium (the code change is one line only).
    + Again, remove the non-free win32/ResizableDialog.* as it is
      still(!) distributed with official source.
    + Add ChangeLog from 2.0.0 missing from current release.

icecast2 (2.0.0.debian-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-release with non-free files (unused with Debian) stripped from
    source:
    + Remove non-free win32/ResizableDialog.* from source, and remove
      its copyright and licensing info from debian/copyright.
    + Add to debian/copyright GPL info taken from newer CVS, and email
      from upstream to BTS permitting it to be used also with this
      earlier release.
    + This closes: Bug#229720, thanks to upstream and Steve Langasek
      <vorlon@debian.org>.
  * Add TODO.Debian with reminder to clean this mess later.

      See bug#229720) with that of individual files where provided.
  * Update debian/watch with new location.
  * Use username icecast2 (instead of icecast also used in the package
    icecast-server). Add NEWS.Debian with info on the change. Closes:
    bug#215671, #226807, thanks to Michael Deegan
    <debbts@cnspc18.murdoch.edu.au> and Robin Lee Powell
    <rlpowell@digitalkingdom.org>.
  * Make sure /etc/icecast2 is owned by icecast2 and not world readable.
    Closes: bug#210860, thanks to Frank Barknecht <fbar@footils.org>.
  * Install NEWS again (now that NEWS and ChangeLog are different).
  * Build-depend on libcurl2-dev (again, and hope it works now...).
    Closes: Bug#222274 thanks to Nicholas Humfrey <njh@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  * Let icecast2 go into background by itself (using -b). Closes:
    Bug#204061 (and add the actual content of the bugreport - how to
    bind to a priviledged port by starting as root - to README.Debian),
    thanks to Jürgen A. Erhard <jae@jerhard.org>.

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030802-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a 'watch' file to automate tracking of updates.
  * Now uses dh-buildinfo to store information about the package build
    environment.  Added a Build-Dependancy to dh-buildinfo.
  * Removed cdbs/autotools-vars.mk, from cdbs CVS, because a new release
    was made.
  * Enabled curl during configure stage, since --disable-curl was recently
    broken upstream, and potentially broken YP support can be disabled at
    runtime.
  * Trimmed ancient upgrade nodes and other cruft, left over from
    pre-Debian versions, from README.Debian.
  * Removed some autotools build cruft, since bugs were fixed upstream.
  * Normalized {preinst,postinst,postrm} filenames to
    icecast2.{preinst,postinst,postrm}.  Thanks to Emmanuel le Chevoir
    for this suggestion.
  * Fixed preinst; was stopping /usr/bin/icecast instead of
    /usr/bin/icecast2.  Thanks to Emmanuel le Chevoir for this suggestion.
  * Removed prerm, since it was not serving any purpose.  Thanks to
    Emmanuel le Chevoir for this suggestion.
  * Cleaned up postinst: removed old comments, fixed a path typo in the
    configuration file location change message.
  * Cleaned up postrm: removed old comments, fixed a typo in the group
    removal test.
  * Thanks to Jonas Smedegaard for sponsoring this package, and
    providing many good suggestions.

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030720-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New daily snapshot build.
  * Added Build-Dependancy to cdbs, and increased debhelper version
    requirement as recommended by cdbs README.
  * Corrected Standards-Version to 3.6.0.  This package now generates
    no lintian errors.
  * Updated Recommends for ices to ices2; it was renamed.
  * Added more information to the long description.
  * Thanks to Jonas Smedegaard for sponsoring this package.
  * This revision still closes: #178160 - the last was not uploaded.

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030714-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sponsored upload. Closes: Bug#178160.
  * Switch to cdbs (agreed with maintainer).
  * Use cdbs autotools-vars.mk from CVS to avoid cross-compiling on same
    host.
  * Add build-dependency on libxml2-dev.
  * Explicitly configure without curl support to avoid building broken
    YP stuff.
  * Hack src/Makefile.am to use AM_CFLAGS instead of CFLAGS (which is
    overridden by cdbs), and add clean rule to avoid invoking automake.
  * Disable daemon by default and hint about changing passwords before
    enabling.
  * Avoid moving config files from pre-Debian times - instead just print
    a warning if config exists in old location (better mess as little as
    possible with files not ever claimed to be ours).
  * Update README.Debian to reflect the above, include note about YP
    support not compiled in, and remove note regarding adoption.
  * Strip paths from packaging scripts (they may move around in the
    future, and if PATH is wrong then something else broken anyway).
  * Avoid removing unused /usr/share/icecast2 on purge.
  * Remove icecast group on purge only if empty.
  * Standards-version 3.6 (no changes needed).
  * Fix wrong escaping of sed vars in conf/Makefile.
  * Symlink public files from /usr/share/icecast2 to /etc/icecast2
    (instead of pointing public root dirs below /etc).
  * Use upstream config (paths are properly included now).

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphasnap2+20030714-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New daily snapshot build.
  * Updated versioning scheme to reflect (as well as possible) that the 
    source is a daily snapshot now, not CVS.

 -- Keegan Quinn <ice@thebasement.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 2003 19:39:58 -0700

icecast2 (1.9+2.0alphacvs030704-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Constructed a build script to completely automate the construction
    of the 'pristine' tarball from CVS.  This doesn't really effect the
    contents of the package, just makes it easier for me to rebuild.
  * New CVS source.
  * Removed Build-Dependancy on libcurl2-dev; packages built without this
    library present will not have YP functionality, which is okay for
    now since it's badly broken.
  * Updated the default configuration file, including some new options
    recently added upstream.
  * Added a number of tweaks to clean up and rearrange new configuration
    and documentation added to upstream install target.
  * Moved the configuration file from /etc/icecast.xml to
    /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml.  See README.Debian.
  * Nice ugly version number to reflect that upstream calls this the 2.0
    alpha branch, without potentially introducing the need for an epoch.
